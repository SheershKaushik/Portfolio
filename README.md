## [II Cultiv8](https://abc)
As the Technical Lead for a Durham University team called Cultiv8 in the Startup Blueprint Challenge, I led the creation of an innovative dashboard for students and travelers. Using Python, Streamlit, Generative AI, LLMs, and the Gemini Pro API, we developed a dynamic tool providing personalized recommendations for attractions, events, dining, and part-time jobs based on the user's live location. This project highlighted my leadership and technical skills in integrating advanced technologies to deliver practical solutions. 

## [III Application Tracking System](https://abc)
I developed an advanced Application Tracking System to evaluate how well a resume matches a job description. By analyzing both inputs, the system identifies missing keywords and skills and estimates the likelihood of shortlisting by recruiters. Using Python, LLMs, Generative AI, Google Gemini API, and Streamlit for the interface, this tool leverages machine learning and NLP. Originally for personal use, it has great potential to assist students and professionals in optimizing their job applications. 

## [IV Customer Segmentation](https://abc)
Developed a Customer Segmentation Clustering system using Python to optimize marketing strategies by identifying distinct customer groups. Segmented grocery firm customers using unsupervised learning based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and engagement metrics. Key steps included data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and agglomerative clustering, resulting in 4 distinct customer profiles based on family structure and income/spending patterns. This project demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning and data analysis, offering actionable insights for tailored marketing and improved customer engagement.
