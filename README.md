Handling missing values in a dataset is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of data analysis and machine learning models. Here are several common methods for handling missing values:

1. **Deletion**:
   - **Listwise deletion (Complete Case Analysis)**: Entire rows containing missing values are removed from the dataset. This method is straightforward but may result in loss of valuable information, especially if missing values are common.
   - **Pairwise deletion**: Missing values are ignored for specific calculations or analyses, such as correlation calculations. While it retains more data compared to listwise deletion, it can introduce bias if missingness is not completely random.
