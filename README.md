## [Analysing Domestic Venturing](https://abc)
Exemplified exceptional focus by channeling my comprehensive knowledge acquired during the Master's degree into a compelling dissertation on 'Effects of Institutions on Domestic Venturing'. This study investigates the impact of institutional factors on domestic venturing using a dataset of 2000 articles (2004-2023). Analytical methods included BERT embedding, cosine similarity, thematic analysis, sentiment analysis, time-series analysis, and word clouds. Findings highlight factors' significance, temporal trends, and their role as catalysts or impediments providing insights for stakeholders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs to inform decision-making and strategic planning.

Handling missing values in a dataset is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of data analysis and machine learning models. Here are several common methods for handling missing values:

 **Imputation**:
   - **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Missing values are replaced with the mean, median, or mode of the respective feature. This method is simple and quick but may distort the original distribution and relationships in the data.
   - **Random value**: Missing values are replaced with random values ranging between specified limits.
   - **Forward Fill/Backward Fill**: Missing values are filled with the preceding (forward fill) or succeeding (backward fill) non-missing value along the same feature. This method is suitable for time-series data.
   - **Interpolation**: Missing values are estimated based on the values of neighboring data points. Methods like linear interpolation or spline interpolation can be used.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**: Missing values are imputed based on the values of K nearest neighbors, using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance.
   - **Multiple Imputation**: Multiple sets of imputed values are generated to account for uncertainty in the imputation process. Techniques like Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) are commonly used.
   - **Regression Imputation**: Missing values are predicted using regression models trained on non-missing values of other features.
*:
   - **Flagging Missing Values**: Missing values can be replaced with a special value (e.g., -999 or NaN) to indicate their absence. This approach maintains the integrity of the dataset but requires careful handling during analysis and modeling.

Handling missing values in a dataset is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of data analysis and machine learning models. Here are several common methods for handling missing values:

1. **Deletion**:
   - **Listwise deletion (Complete Case Analysis)**: Entire rows containing missing values are removed from the dataset. This method is straightforward but may result in loss of valuable information, especially if missing values are common.
   - **Pairwise deletion**: Missing values are ignored for specific calculations or analyses, such as correlation calculations. While it retains more data compared to listwise deletion, it can introduce bias if missingness is not completely random.

2. **Imputation**:
   - **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Missing values are replaced with the mean, median, or mode of the respective feature. This method is simple and quick but may distort the original distribution and relationships in the data.
   - **Random value**: Missing values are replaced with random values ranging between specified limits.
   - **Forward Fill/Backward Fill**: Missing values are filled with the preceding (forward fill) or succeeding (backward fill) non-missing value along the same feature. This method is suitable for time-series data.
   - **Interpolation**: Missing values are estimated based on the values of neighboring data points. Methods like linear interpolation or spline interpolation can be used.

   - **Multiple Imputation**: Multiple sets of imputed values are generated to account for uncertainty in the imputation process. Techniques like Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) are commonly used.
   - **Regression Imputation**: Missing values are predicted using regression models trained on non-missing values of other features.
   
3. **Prediction Models**:
   - **Use of Machine Learning Algorithms**: Missing values can be treated as a predictive modeling problem, where the missing values are predicted using machine learning algorithms trained on the non-missing values.
   
4. **Domain Knowledge**:
   - **Manual Imputation**: Domain knowledge can be used to manually impute missing values based on expert judgment or external sources of information.
   - **Business Rules**: Business rules or logical constraints specific to the domain can guide the imputation of missing values.

5. **Special Values**:
   - **Flagging Missing Values**: Missing values can be replaced with a special value (e.g., -999 or NaN) to indicate their absence. This approach maintains the integrity of the dataset but requires careful handling during analysis and modeling.
