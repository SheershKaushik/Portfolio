## Cultiv8 
As the Technical Lead for a Durham University team called Cultiv8, I spearheaded our participation in the prestigious Startup Blueprint Challenge. Our project aimed to revolutionize the way students and travelers explore new cities by developing an intelligent, user-friendly dashboard.

I successfully transformed our innovative concept into a fully functional application, leveraging cutting-edge technologies including Python, Streamlit, Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and the Gemini Pro API. The dashboard dynamically provides users with personalized recommendations based on their real-time location, offering a seamless experience to discover:

 - Top attractions and must-visit places
 - Current and upcoming local events
 - Popular dining options
 - Available part-time job opportunities
   
This project not only demonstrated my ability to lead a diverse team and manage complex technical implementations but also showcased my proficiency in integrating various advanced technologies to create impactful, real-world solutions.

## ATS 
To enhance my job application process, I developed an advanced Application Tracking System designed to evaluate the alignment between a resume and a job description. This system analyzes two inputsâ€”the resume and the job descriptionâ€”to identify missing keywords and skills, and estimates the likelihood of the resume being shortlisted by recruiters based on their criteria.

Leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, I utilized Python, Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, and the Google Gemini API to build this sophisticated tool. The user interface was seamlessly created using Streamlit.

While originally developed for personal use, this project has significant potential for broader application, benefiting students and professionals by optimizing their job search and application processes.

 **Imputation**:
   - **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Missing values are replaced with the mean, median, or mode of the respective feature. This method is simple and quick but may distort the original distribution and relationships in the data.
   - **Random value**: Missing values are replaced with random values ranging between specified limits.
   - **Forward Fill/Backward Fill**: Missing values are filled with the preceding (forward fill) or succeeding (backward fill) non-missing value along the same feature. This method is suitable for time-series data.
   - **Interpolation**: Missing values are estimated based on the values of neighboring data points. Methods like linear interpolation or spline interpolation can be used.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**: Missing values are imputed based on the values of K nearest neighbors, using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance.
   - **Multiple Imputation**: Multiple sets of imputed values are generated to account for uncertainty in the imputation process. Techniques like Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) are commonly used.
   - **Regression Imputation**: Missing values are predicted using regression models trained on non-missing values of other features.
*:
   - **Flagging Missing Values**: Missing values can be replaced with a special value (e.g., -999 or NaN) to indicate their absence. This approach maintains the integrity of the dataset but requires careful handling during analysis and modeling.

## Application Tracking System 
Handling missing values in a dataset is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of data analysis and machine learning models. Here are several common methods for handling missing values:

1. **Deletion**:
   - **Listwise deletion (Complete Case Analysis)**: Entire rows containing missing values are removed from the dataset. This method is straightforward but may result in loss of valuable information, especially if missing values are common.
   - **Pairwise deletion**: Missing values are ignored for specific calculations or analyses, such as correlation calculations. While it retains more data compared to listwise deletion, it can introduce bias if missingness is not completely random.

2. **Imputation**:
   - **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Missing values are replaced with the mean, median, or mode of the respective feature. This method is simple and quick but may distort the original distribution and relationships in the data.
   - **Random value**: Missing values are replaced with random values ranging between specified limits.
   - **Forward Fill/Backward Fill**: Missing values are filled with the preceding (forward fill) or succeeding (backward fill) non-missing value along the same feature. This method is suitable for time-series data.
   - **Interpolation**: Missing values are estimated based on the values of neighboring data points. Methods like linear interpolation or spline interpolation can be used.

   - **Multiple Imputation**: Multiple sets of imputed values are generated to account for uncertainty in the imputation process. Techniques like Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) are commonly used.
   - **Regression Imputation**: Missing values are predicted using regression models trained on non-missing values of other features.
   
3. **Prediction Models**:
   - **Use of Machine Learning Algorithms**: Missing values can be treated as a predictive modeling problem, where the missing values are predicted using machine learning algorithms trained on the non-missing values.
   
4. **Domain Knowledge**:
   - **Manual Imputation**: Domain knowledge can be used to manually impute missing values based on expert judgment or external sources of information.
   - **Business Rules**: Business rules or logical constraints specific to the domain can guide the imputation of missing values.

5. **Special Values**:
   - **Flagging Missing Values**: Missing values can be replaced with a special value (e.g., -999 or NaN) to indicate their absence. This approach maintains the integrity of the dataset but requires careful handling during analysis and modeling.
